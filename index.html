				I am a programmer and game designer with an education in computer science and math. I originally learned how to program while making my first game in 2008, and have been working to continue that ever since. I dabbled in map building in Minecraft and <nobr>Halo: Reach</nobr>, but really found a home with <nobr>Super Mario Maker</nobr> after graduating from college in 2018. Since then, I have had more opportunities to do my own game development projects.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I'm currently looking for employment in game development.

						A top-down stealth game prototype built using GameMaker Studio 2 over a four-day weekend. My goal was to give enemies basic self-preservation instincts by having them call for backup before going to check a suspicious noise.

							What I did:
							<li>All enemy logic design, programming, and art</li>
							<li>Built a library to make animation programming function how I expect it to</li>

				Sometimes Super Mario Maker level-makers like to play tricks on the player to add a bit of life to a difficult puzzle or platforming challenge.
				These tricks are referred to in the SMM community as "trolls", and levels that are built <i>entirely</i> out of these tricks, repeatedly anticipating and subverting the player's expectations, are known as "troll levels".
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Making a good troll level requires finesse to ensure that the trolls are effective, the deception is entertaining, and the player has enough information to continue through the level once they have been "trolled". These elements make the playtesting/revision loop crucial and reward a strong understanding of the player's thought process.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I've been a part of the community surrounding these levels since mid-2018, and they make up the majority of the levels showcased here.

						A solo troll level that uses a "collect all coins" clear condition to lure the player into traps. The most fun bits focus on giving the player plenty of information while still knowing they'll do the wrong thing.

						A huge, 17-maker collab troll level. Much of the fun of this level comes from how often it reuses its own setups and tricks to form comedic callbacks.
						<ul>
							What I did:
							<li>
								Headed the project along with three other makers
							</li>
							<li>
								Built the level out of the 17 makers' individual sections
							</li>
							<li>
								Handled the entire playtesting/revision process
							</li>

						A challenge level where the player covers the same territory three times with different powerups. The main point of interest is the pseudo-checkpoints across the map that supply extras of each type of powerup, but only once you've already unlocked that type.

						A solo troll level, often using very common low-brow hazards in fresh ways to make them new again. The highlight point, the second checkpoint, hinges on giving the player just enough time to panic and overthink themselves into the wrong solution.

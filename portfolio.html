				I'm a programmer and game designer from Ohio with an education in computer science and math. I originally learned how to program while making my first game in 2008, and have been working to continue that ever since. I dabbled in map building in Minecraft and Halo: Reach, but really found a home with Super Mario Maker in 2018.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I'm currently looking for work in the game development field.

						A top-down stealth game prototype built using GameMaker Studio 2 over a 4-day weekend. The focus was on giving enemies basic self-preservation by having them call for backup before going to check a suspicious noise.

				Sometimes Super Mario Maker level-makers like to play tricks on the player to add a bit of life to a difficult puzzle or platforming challenge.
				These tricks are referred to in the SMM community as "trolls", and levels that are built <i>entirely</i> out of these tricks, repeatedly anticipating and subverting the player's expectations, are known as "troll levels".
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Making a good troll level requires finesse to ensure that the trolls are effective, the deception is entertaining, and the player has enough information to continue through the level once they have been "trolled". These elements make the playtesting/revision loop crucial and reward a strong understanding of the player's thought process.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I've been a part of the community surrounding these levels since mid-2018, and they make up the majority of the levels showcased here.

						My only solo SMM2 troll level. The best fun of the level is in parts that focus on giving the player plenty of information while still knowing they'll do the wrong thing.

						A huge, 17-maker collab troll level. Much of the fun of this level comes from how often it reuses its own setups and tricks to form comedic callbacks.
						<ul>
							What I did:
							<li>
								Headed the project along with three other makers
							</li>
							<li>
								Built the level out of the 17 makers' individual sections
							</li>
							<li>
								Handled the entire playtesting/revision process
							</li>

						A challenge level where the player covers the same territory three times with different powerups. The main point of interest is pseudo-checkpoints that supply a certain type of powerup, but only once you already have that type of powerup.

						A solo troll level, often using very common low-brow hazards in fresh ways to make them new again. The highlight point hinges on giving the player just enough time to panic and overthink themselves into the wrong solution.

				Sometimes Super Mario Maker level-makers like to play tricks on the player to add a bit of life to a difficult puzzle or platforming challenge.
				These tricks are referred to in the SMM community as "trolls", and levels that are built <i>entirely</i> out of these tricks, repeatedly anticipating and subverting the player's expectations, are known as "troll levels".
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Making a good troll level requires finesse to ensure that the trolls are effective, the deception is entertaining, and the player has enough information to continue through the level once they have been "trolled". These elements make the playtesting/revision loop crucial and reward a strong understanding of the player's thought process.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I've been a part of the community surrounding these levels since mid-2018, and they make up the majority of the levels showcased here.

						A solo SMM2 troll level, mostly to prove to myself that I could still make one. Some of the best moments in this level (namely the bomb in room 2 and the spring in room 4) hinge on giving the player plenty of information but still knowing they'll do the wrong thing.

						This was a 17-person project that I headed up over the 2 months leading up to May 11th, 2020. My contributions to this project included:
						<ul>
							<li>creating a few modules to put into the level</li>
							<li>putting the level together out of the modules that the other builders and I created</li>
							<li>submitting the level to playtesters and watching their playthroughs</li>
							<li>revising the level based on the playtests</li>
						</ul>
						The last two points are most important, since they mean that I was in charge of most of the work after the initial modules were complete, which in this case means the second half of the project time-wise.

						The goal of this level was to sidestep the "no checkpoints" restriction on levels with clear conditions. I accomplished this by adding pseudo-checkpoints through the use of powerups and powerup dispensers behind blocks that can only be broken in certain powerup states.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						The part that makes the level interesting is that, although you're repeatedly going through the same area, the location of the most difficult part changes each time based on your powerup state:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Small Mario is tricky toward the end because the checkpoints don't work yet
							</li>
							<li>
								Super Mario has some difficulty with the low-flying ghosts and has to slow down and duck
							</li>
							<li>
								Builder Mario has to be careful with the ghosts over pits since the "checkpoints" can't save you from the abyss
							</li>
						</ul>
						This keeps the gameplay fresh despite using the same structures and obstacles each time.

						My second troll level. This was near the end of SMM1's lifespan (right before SMM2 came out) so the ending is a bit less complete than I would've liked. I brought in some of my skills in music levels and added some skeleton-themed songs. The moment just before collecting checkpoint 2 is a personal favorite.

						This was my first successful troll level. The failed attempts before it taught me what I should be going for, and the playtesting I got on this one helped it swerve from disaster in the last few weeks before its final release. I'm particularly happy with the checkpoint 2 fakeout and the ending.
